# Spins Systems

This repo contains all thing about my 2020 IC research. I worked with Professor Heitor C. M. Fernandes, from the Complex Fluids Group IF-UFRGS. I studied Spins Systems for a while, my goal was to parallelize my codes. I pause this project for a while, but I'm still studying how to achieve this. I will talk about the Ising Model and what I learned about it.

## Ising 2D

If you know Portuguese I highly recommend this [wiki](https://fiscomp.if.ufrgs.br/index.php/Ising_2D) about the Ising Model. In english there is the usual [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model). 

The Ising Model I worked is mathematically described by

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{H} = -J \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} s_i s_j
\end{equation}
